mcmc-examples
=============

This repository is for teaching/learning purposes, and contains simple examples of Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo in R.

The MonteCarlo directory is for "simple Monte Carlo", and the MCMC directory for Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Many of the examples are, at least as I set this repo up, coming from population genetics. But that is not a requirement.

If you would like to contribute your own examples, please fork the repo and send a pull request when your examples
are complete. Examples should ideally be documented enough so that a beginning student can follow what is going on.
Ideally use .R or .Rmd files.
